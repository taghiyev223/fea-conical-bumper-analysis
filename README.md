# Conical Bumper Assembly – Structural & Fatigue Analysis (FEA)

This project investigates the structural integrity and fatigue life of a conical bumper assembly using advanced finite element analysis techniques. The study focuses on nonlinear material behavior, contact interactions, stress distribution, and fatigue evaluation according to the **FKM Guideline**.

## 🔧 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the load-carrying capacity, deformation behavior, and durability of a conical bumper unit under operational loads. Using ANSYS Workbench, multiple simulations were performed to study:

- Nonlinear elastic–plastic material behavior  
- Contact between assembly components  
- Stress and deformation profiles  
- Fatigue safety factors according to FKM  

A refined mesh and convergence-guided workflow were applied to ensure accurate and reliable results.
