# 📘 Conical Bumper Assembly – Structural & Fatigue Analysis (FEA)

This project analyzes the structural integrity, deformation behavior, and fatigue life of a **conical bumper assembly** using advanced nonlinear finite element methods in **ANSYS Workbench**.  
The study focuses on realistic operating conditions, including **elastic–plastic material behavior**, **contact interactions**, **stress concentrations**, and fatigue evaluation according to the **FKM Guideline**.

## 🚀 Motivation

Conical bumper assemblies are widely used as protective or energy-absorbing elements in mechanical systems. Their complex geometry and contact-dominated behavior require detailed simulation to ensure structural reliability.  

This project was carried out as part of an Advanced Simulation course to deepen skills in:

- Nonlinear FEA  
- Mesh refinement strategies  
- Contact formulation  
- Fatigue safety assessment  
- Engineering documentation & reporting

## 🧩 Project Objectives

- Evaluate the **load-carrying capacity** of the conical bumper assembly  
- Analyze **deformation mechanisms** under operational loads  
- Investigate **stress distribution** and critical zones  
- Determine **fatigue safety factors** using the FKM Guideline  
- Provide engineering recommendations based on simulation results
